When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	A remote repository would be helpful when multiple computers or 
	programmers will be used or working on a project.  It will also 
	provide a backup of the development.

	Notes:
	to add a remote repo: git remote add origin url
	to see what url is the remote: git remote -v
	to upload to GitHub: git push origin master     
	to update from GitHub: git pull origin master

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Doing a manual pull allows one to determine when and where the
	latest changes will be incorporated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  

	A fork is a GitHub feature that allows one to make a copy of a 
	public repo and do their own development.
	A clone is a copy of a repo, either on GitHub or local machine.
	A brance is a separate development path for a local repo.

	Make a fork on GitHub, then it would probably be good to clone
	that repo to local machine for development:
	$ git clone [url]

Notes on merging with conflicts:
	Say my master and orgin/master (the remote repo) are out of sink
	and have conflics (changes to the same bit of code).  In the class
	example, I did a $ git fetch.  This makes a branch on my repo.  Now
	I would have master and origin/master.  I can do a $ git diff and 
	see the conflicts and fix them.  Then I $ git add and $ git commit
	these changes to resolve the conflict.  Finally, I can $ git push 
	to the orgin/master and save all the changes and fixes.

	The $ git fetch is a good way to pull down the current repo without
	losing my current changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	The benefit is that you have a chance to compare the remote and local
	versions of the repo and look for conflicts.  Then the conflicts can 
	resolved and pushed to the origin/master.
