What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

	The git init command makes a .git file in the directory, which 
	contains the git data used to track changes and all the other
	git stuff.  This is neccessary to start a git repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area lets git know what files to commit and lets the 
	user select those files individually, and bundle them for a commit. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Use the "git diff --staged" to check if the changes are significant 
	enough between the staged and committed versions.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized?  How would branches help?

	Use "git branch" to see what branch I'm on. 
	Use "git branch [name of new]" to make a new branch.
	Use "git checkout [name of desired branch] to start working on it
	Branches would be useful to test or develop a parallel feature
	of the code.  Doing work on a branch would ensure the previous 
	development is not affected.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	Use "git log --graph --oneline" to see the visual representation of
	the git history.  This helps to see the parents of a branch and the
	parallel development of the repo.

What is the result of merging two branges together?  Why do we represeent it
in the diagram the way we do?

	Use "git merge " and something about branch 1 and branch 2.  The 
	result is that the two parallel branches are combined into one.  
	Git is able to look at the parent paths and intellegently combine
	the two branches (unless there are conflicts that need to be 
	manually fixed).
