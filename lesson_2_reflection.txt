What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

	The git init command makes a .git file in the directory, which 
	contains the git data used to track changes and all the other
	git stuff.  This is neccessary to start a git repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area lets git know what files to commit and lets the 
	user select those files individually.
